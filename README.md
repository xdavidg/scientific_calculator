## 🚀 **Features**

### 🎯 **Core Functionalities**

- **Transcendental Functions**:

  - `arccos(x)`
  - `ab^x` (Exponentiation with variable base `b`)
  - `logb(x)` (Logarithm with variable base `b`)
  - `Γ(x)` (Gamma Function)
  - `sinh(x)`

- **Statistical Functions**:

  - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
  - Standard Deviation (σ)

- **Arithmetic and Trigonometric Essentials**:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
  - Sine (`sin`), Cosine (`cos`), Tangent (`tan`)
  - Exponentiation (`x^y`)
